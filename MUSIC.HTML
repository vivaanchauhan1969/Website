    <h1>./Music</h1>
    <p> I started the band in Middle school and I picked percussion  as my instrument (percussion  are instruments that u can hit and they make a sound so things like drums sets and marimbas and vibraphone and xylophone and on and on and on and on...) after I first tried playing music I liked it a lot  and I even started to create my own music, I really love making music and play it and I hope to do it in high school too!</p>
