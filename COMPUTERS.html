    <p>I also love computers when I first started I thought that coding and programming was like hacking into a big corp. although some parts of programming are hacking not all of it, I started off by learning Python people told me that it was easy to learn so I tried it, it took me a while to understand what was going on but I understood it after a while, then I learned C using CS50, then I switched my focus to game development, especially Roblox, and now I am learning many different things like HTML, C, JSON. So I love the fact that I can just make anything I want out of thin air, but I still like the hacking part better ;).</p>
