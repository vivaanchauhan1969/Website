    <p>I also love computers when I first started out I thought that coding and programming was like hacking into a big corp. although, some part of programming is hacking not all of it, I started off by learning python people told me that it was easy to learn so I tryed it, it took me a while to under stand what was going on but I understood it after a while, then I learned C useing CS50, then I swicthed my focus to game devlopment especially roblox, and now I am learing many diffrent thing like HTML,C,Json. So I love the fact that I can just make anything I want out of thin air, but I still like the hacking part better ;).</p>
